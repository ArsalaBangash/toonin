Toonin is a Chrome Extension coupled with a web app that allows your friends to Tune In to what you're listening to. 

## Overview

Toonin consists of a Chrome extension, a web application, and a signaling server. WebRTC is used to stream the music from the provider to its peers. 

In order to exchange information, a signaling server must exist between the provider (Chrome Extension) and the peers (Web App)


## Development setup

We provide a setup script that installs all necessary dependencies. 
```sh
bash setup.sh
```

## Running Toonin

### Running the web app
Enter the web app directory and serve the app on your machine
```sh
cd client
npm run serve
```

### Running the extension
Enter the extension directory and run the development script for the extension. 
```sh
cd extension
npm run dev
```

This packs the extension under the build directory and watches your extension files for local changes. 

Use [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) to load the extension into chrome. 

### Running the signalling server
Enter the backend directory and run the signalling server. 
```sh
cd backend
node index.js
```
