# Contributing to Toonin

### Toonin is a fun app to build! 
We use many modern web technologies and there are a lot of cool features our team hasn't explored. 
Interested in participating? 
We suggest you start by:

1. Acquainting yourself with Grey Software's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/grey-software/Grey-Software/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md).
2. Scanning our issues page for a feature/bug-fix you'd like to get started with, or propose your own.
3. [Emailing us](mailto:software.grey@protonmail.com?subject=Contributing-To-Toonin) at software.grey@protonmail.com with the subject line "Contributing-To-Toonin" if you'd like to get a more formal process of onboarding started.

Thank you for your interest!
