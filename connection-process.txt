1) create room from request from extension
	- create a new network tree for the room with root node as src

2) "new peer" from client (request to join the room)
	- src responds by creating and RTC conn and sending src ice candidate
	- socket.emit "src new ice"

3) backend emits "src ice" in the room which is picked by client

4) ice candidates are exchanged(?) and webRTC connection is attempted
