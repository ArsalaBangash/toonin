1) Forward Title appropriately

2) Update all RTC connections when root node disconnects
    a) Close RTC connection of immediate children when parent
       disconnects. This would recursively reset all clients
       as required.

3) Handle disconnection of non-root node
    a) Need to reconnect only the immediate children.
    b) Update video and audio stream for children of immediate
       children
        i) this should recursively update the entire affected 
           part of thenetwork

4) Report listener count to root node to display accurate stat in
   extension
    a) Could just get node count from tree - 1 from signalling
       server
    b) Could just have each node report its client count to parent
       and root node would get the total count recursively. This
       is better for a more decentralized approach but more complex
       to implement than simply returning tree size from backend

5) Update network trees properly when any node disconnects
   (delete nodes from tree when they disconnect to make sure
   that new nodes don't try to connect)

6) Have dynamic MAX_CLIENT_SIZE count per node depending on
   upload bandwith
    a) This should mean higher clients/node for audio and less
       for video
